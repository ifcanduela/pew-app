# Pew-Pew-Pew

> An amateur PHP framework.

The repository only hosts a base app to use with [ifcanduela/pew](https://github.com/ifcanduela/pew).

# Quickstart

You need PHP 7.0 with the `mbstring` extension enabled and [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/).

1. Clone this repository and move into it.
2. Modify the `composer.json` file as you need.
3. Run `composer install`.
4. Run `php serve`.

# Creating a basic web application

Pew web applications are made up of **controller actions**, which are methods bound to URLs. When a
URL is requested, it is compared against the defined routes, and if one matches its controller and
action are used to generate a response.

Routes are defined in the `app\config\routes.php` file. This file should return an array with route
declarations, which come in several flavors. A full route declaration looks like this:

```php
return [
    [
        'path' => '/post[/{slug}]',
        'controller' => 'Posts@view',
        'methods' => 'GET',
        'defaults' => [
            'slug' => 'home'
        ]
    ],
];
```

You can use the `Route` class to define the same route:

```php
use pew\router\Route;

return [
    Route::from('/post[/{slug}]')
        ->handler('Posts@view')
        ->methods('get')
        ->defaults(['slug' => 'home']),
];
```

This route will match URLs like `posts` and `posts/my-blog-post`. In both cases the `view()` method
of the `\app\controllers\Posts` class will be called. If the `slug` part of the URL is not present,
a value of `home` will be passed to the method's `$slug` argument.

  learn about path patterns.

An almost-equivalent route can be written in short form:

```php
return [
    '/post[/{slug}]' => 'Posts@view',
];
```

The slug here is optional, but it has no default, which means you have to give it one in the
controller action:

```php
class Post
{
    public function view($slug = 'home')
    {
        return [
            'post' => Post::findOneBySlug($slug)
        ];
    }
}
```

You can also define a `slug` key in the `app\config\config.php` file, since action methods receive their
argument values from the injection container, and the config file is one of the sources (the others
being the GET and POST arrays, the services configuration file (`pew\config\bootstrap.php`) and the
route itself).

Finally, you can pass an anonymous function as the handler to a route. The function can ask for arguments
the same way a controller action would, and the `$this` pseudo-variable in the body of the function is
bound to an instance of `pew\Controller`:

```php
'/post[/{slug}]' => function ($slug) {
    echo $this->renderJson(['slug' => $slug]);
},
```

## Create a controller

Controllers can be just simple classes with one or more methods. A base controller is provided,
which simplifies redirect and JSON responses, but it's not required. A basic controller might look
like this:

```php
<?php

namespace app\controllers;

use app\models\Cat;

class Cats
{
    public function view($name)
    {
        $cats = Cat::find()
            ->where(['name' => $name]))
            ->orderBy('date_of_birth ASC')
            ->all();

        return [
            'cats' => $cats,
        ];
    }
}

```

In this case, the template file `app\views\cats\view.php` will be rendered, with a variable called
`$cats` being available. The template is automatically selected based on the controller and action
names, but it can be modified by requesting the `$view` object to be injected:

```php
public function view($name, $view)
{
    $view->template('animals/overview');

    // ...
}
```

The base controller class add the `renderJson()` and `redirect()`  methods, whose results must be
`return`ed by the action method:

```php
public function index($name, $request)
{
    if ($request->isPost()) {
        return $this->renderJson(Cat::find()->all());
    }

    return $this->redirect('/home');
}
```

The return value of the action is used to create variables in the template. A return value of
`false` will prevent any template from being rendered.

## Models

Model classes represent records in a database table and will hold most of the real code of the
application. This is a quick example (`app\models\Cat.php`):

```php
<?php

namespace app\models;

class Cat extends \pew\Model
{
    public $tableName = 'cats';
}
```

By extending `\pew\Model`, you get access to some features, like the `find()` and `fromArray()`
static methods and the `save()` method that will persist the model data to the database.

## Templating

Templates are chosen automatically using the controller and action names, but they can also be set
explicitly. In the following example, setting the template to `cats/view` has no effect because
that's the predefined view name for the `Cats::view()` action:

```php
<?php

namespace app\controllers;

class Cats
{
    public function view($name, $view)
    {
        $view->template('cats/view');

        return [
            'cat' => $this->model->find_by_name($name)
        ];
    }
}
```

Template names are always relative to the `app/views` directory, and must not include the `.php`
extension.

Inside the `app/views/cats/view.php` template we can use the `$cat` variable to print information
about the cat:

```php
<div class="cat-info">
    <h1><?= $cat->name ?></h1>

    <ul>
        <?php foreach ($cat->hobbies as $hobby): ?>
            <li><?= $hobby ?></li>
        <?php endforeach ?>
    </ul>
</div>
```

There's also the possibility of rendering the view within a layout:

```php
<?php $this->layout('layouts/main') ?>

<div class="cat-info">
    <h1><?= $cat->name ?></h1>

    <!-- ... -->
</div>
```
